# Continuous improvement from Dev to Production

 <img src="images/CIdemo.jpg" width="750" height="450" />


<br>
This is a tutorial to setup a sandbox environment that focusses on <br>
how "Dynatrace Automated SLO Evaluation" can be implemented into an <br>
Automated Software Delivery Process. <br> 
<br>
<br>
The functions outside the SLO Evaluation like Deployments and <br>
Testing are not necessarily best practise, they were designed to serve the Purpose <br>
to Quickly Test or Demo the Slo Evaluation Process from Dev to Production without <br>
having to wait hours for a delivery step like Testing to complete. <br>
<br>


# Prerequisites  
<br>
 
### The following Accounts and Tokens are needed to create this Sandbox 
<br>

|  Vendor      | Prerequisite |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Dynatrace   | Account, Api Token, Data Ingest Token        |
| Dynatrace Cloudautomation  | Account, Api Token      |

```
{
    "type": "test",
    "series": [
        {
            "timeseriesId": "custom:releaseevaluationscore",
            "dimensions": {
                "Score": {
                    {.data.evaluation.score
                    }
                },
                "Result": "{{.data.result}}",
                "Passed": 0,

                    {.data.labels.buildId
                    }
                },
                "Evaluationtime": "{{.time}}",
                "Application": "simplenodeservice-{{.data.stage}}"
            },
            "dataPoints": [
                [
                    {
                        {.data.labels.evaltime
                        }
                    },
                    {

                        }
                    }
                ]
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
* Remove all line breaks from the json file so its a one liner (You can use the one liner below)
 ```
 {  "type": "test",  "series": [    {      "timeseriesId": "custom:releaseevaluationscore",      "dimensions": {        "Score" : {{.data.evaluation.score}},        "Result" : "{{.data.result}}",        "Passed" : 0,        "Releaseversion": "{{.data.labels.buildId}}",        "Buildversion": "{{.data.labels.buildId}}",        "Buildnumber":  {{.data.labels.buildId}},        "Evaluationtime": "{{.time}}",        "Application" : "simplenodeservice-{{.data.stage}}"              },      "dataPoints" : [[ {{.data.labels.evaltime}}, {{.data.evaluation.score}} ]]                  }  ]}   
 ```
 
 

* Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the "update subcription" button
* Repeat the same steps as above for the deployment-gates project but with the following content as
payload:

```
{
    "type": "test",
    "series": [
        {
            "timeseriesId": "custom:releaseevaluationscore",
            "dimensions": {
                "Score": {
                    {.data.evaluation.score
                    }
                },
                "Result": "{{.data.result}}",
                "Passed": 0,
                "Releaseversion": "{{.data.labels.buildId}}",
                "Buildversion": "{{.data.labels.buildId}}",
                "Buildnumber": {
                    {.data.labels.buildId
                    }
                },
                "Evaluationtime": "{{.time}}",
                "Application": "simplenodeservice-{{.data.stage}}-DG"
            },
            "dataPoints": [
                [
                    {
                        {.data.labels.evaltime
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        {.data.evaluation.score
                        }
                    }
                ]
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```
Here the one liner for the second wehbook
 ```
 {  "type": "test",  "series": [    {      "timeseriesId": "custom:releaseevaluationscore",      "dimensions": {        "Score" : {{.data.evaluation.score}},        "Result" : "{{.data.result}}",        "Passed" : 0,        "Releaseversion": "{{.data.labels.buildId}}",        "Buildversion": "{{.data.labels.buildId}}",        "Buildnumber":  {{.data.labels.buildId}},        "Evaluationtime": "{{.time}}",        "Application" : "simplenodeservice-{{.data.stage}}-DG"              },      "dataPoints" : [[ {{.data.labels.evaltime}}, {{.data.evaluation.score}} ]]                  }  ]}   
 ```

## Create Github Branches for Staging and Dev
 
* Navigate to the main page of your repository 
* Create a "dev" and "staging" branche from the master Branche, to do so click on the Master Branche Button on the main page
  of your repository, then click view all branches, click on the New Branche button. 
 
 
## Set Workflow Variables

* Navigate to the home of your Github Repository
* Change Current Branche to “dev”

   <img src="images/pasted image 0 (33).png" width="150" height="50" />
<br>



* Switch into directory .”github/workflow”

   <img src="images/pasted image 0 (34).png" width="300" height="250" />
<br>


* Open the dev.yml file for edit

   <img src="images/pasted image 0 (35).png" width="300" height="250" />
<br>


* Set the env: variables

|  Variable    | info | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| GITHUB_PROJECT_URL | https url to the Project of your Github Repo created earlier 
| DOCKER_REPO_URL | Link to the Docker Hub Repo created in the first step 
| DT_URL | Dynatrace URL | 
| DOCKER_TAG | Docker tag of your Docker hub repo created in the first step 


* Commit the change with the following commit message “demo first” This will start the Demo Workflow and Deploy the Initial Application to Dev, Staging <br> <br>
   <img src="images/demofirst.png" width="250" height="250" />
<br>

## Follow Initial Demo Workflow Run
Commiting the changes with the commit message "demo first" will start Initial Demo run. <br>
The first time you kick off the demo there are some initialization steps done and the runs take <br>
significantly longer than when running the demo scenarios later on. <br>

The Initial Demo run will 
* Run the Deployment to dev, have a successful slo evaluation and then merges the dev with the staging branche which kick off
* The Staging Deployment that will also have a successful slo evaluation run and wait for your approval, after you approve
* the Production Workflow will run

You can use the initial demo run to check if everything works. <br>
How this is done can be seen in the following video: [Inital Demo Run](https://dynatrace-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/daniel_braaf/ESkzogAqeNREg_1vNaIZhkABf5gTg5qEQsgAClgTuFm3QQ?e=twQBtt) <br>
<br>

## Demo Functions
The Sandbox Demo has some builtin functions to play through different scenearios. The Functions are controlled by the commit message. <br>
Note! A demo in this Sandbox is always started by making a change to the dev branch, this activates the deployment workflows <br>
in a true gitops fashion
<br>
<br>


|  Commitmsg   | Functionality | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| demo first | Used for the very first run after installation, used to initialize the demo and test if everything works. The Workflows take significantly longer during the initial run and should not be seen as a demo but part of the installation. This only needs to be done the very first time the demo is run after the installation 
| demo | All SLO evaluations in all stages will succeed! The Demo Deploys the new code to Dev, then runs an slo evaluation, the evaluation succeeds and merges the dev branche into the staging branche, which activates the staging deployment workflow, here we deploy to staging, run another evaluation, the evaluation succceeds and the workflow waits for approval. Approval of the workflow will merge the staging branche into the production branche and start deployment to production where first we check if Production is ready to be deployed to by running a pre deployment evaluation, the evaluation succeeds and the deployment to production succeeds. after the deployment to production we run another last slo evaluation to make sure our new changes run smoothly in production.
| demo faildev | the slo evaluation in dev will fail with High CPU and Memory usage, this will crate an issue with a link to the root cause of the problem, we click the link, identify and fix the problem. This is meant to show the advantages Dynatrace SLO evaluation has for Dev, Automatically Identify issues based on slos and provide a fast response with the root cause so the problem can be identified and fixed fast!  | 
| demo failstaging | the slo evaluation in dev will be successful but fail in staging, due to the slo failing the new change is rolled back and an issue created with a link to the root cause of the problem in dynatrace. However since the problem is found in staging we have more people on board that will be notified about the issue. We most likely will have Dev, QA and the Release Manager made aware of the Problem.
